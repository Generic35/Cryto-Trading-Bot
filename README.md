### How it works
- Checks the Ethereum price
- If the ETH price is lower than a certain limit (Stop Loss)
- sells ETH for Dai stable cryptocurrency (A.k.a $USD) on Uniswap which uses one exchange per cryptocurreny pair
- This can be changed to Buy ETH if it dips below a certain point, or doing arbitrage.
